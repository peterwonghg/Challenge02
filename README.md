# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Onjective
Create a portfolio 

## Header
The header is made up of a logo on the left and links to the different parts oif the website using a tags.  The three sections are About Me, Work and Contact

## Subheader
The subheader is made up of an image that occupies the full width of the screen with a tag using the box1c (1 column arrangement)"... coding you can count on".  This tag is sized so that it is legible in different screen sizes.  Tag is fixed to the image and will dissapear as the image scroll off the screen.

## About Me
The about me section uses the box2c a two column arrangement, one column houses the About Me title and the other the content.

"About me" uses the same box2c as the Work with the large image that has a hovering function, so a hover disabled is applied on the content of the "About Me"

## Work (Large Image)
The work section uses box2c arrangement with the Work title in one box and the image spanning the full width of the box.  It is designed to be able to hover using the hover function.

The image descriptor was left out as I am unable to sucessfully maintaining the the image descriptor to the image as the image size is changed.

## Work (small image)
A section containing a total of 4 images arranged in a 3 column arrangement (box3c) with the first column containing the title, the second and third columns contain the small images with hovering feature identical to the larger image.  The same for the next row containing a total of 4 small images.

Same difficulty is experienecd with tagging the images.

alt text were included in all the images.

## Contact
The contact section uses the four columns arrangement (box4c) with the Contact title in the first colummn, telephone, email and linkedin made up the rest of the columns respectively.  The telephone can be chosen and return to the top of the page and the linkedin will link my personal  linkedin url

## Footer
The footer contain a logo.

## Future Improvement Comments
...
As time is running out for submission, i will be highlightinng the deficiencies of this submission.

poor styles orgnisation - previous classes/id not deleted or cleaned up as deletion run the risk of the proper functioning of the portfolio - reorganise

many of the functions in styles can be included in helper or primary - reorganise

Could not figure out how to do a vertical line so a horizontal line to separate content section was used - develop vertical line

No title on the images

Comment overlay also not working for "something interesting" in the subheading over the image

images presented in 2 rows are too small, should be improved with single column for smaller devices with different media query 

navbar can be improved

readme can be improved

Contact email does not show when size reduced - contacty box can be reduced to single column to better show email

footer, not sure if there is an expected format, have not researched enough .... may not be best practice

I definitely can improve this!!! just need time

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
